You can also type ? before the command (eg. ?boo hello) to take your conversation with Jeff into the DMs. Instead of boo, you can also mention @SpookyJeffBot.

The /anon feature

  - Works by using ephemeral = True which takes in the user input and then hides it from the other users
  - After that, it stores the input and then responds with an output with the exact same user input or the anon_message with .followup.send but it's now from the bot's side and no one can see who originally sent it.
